      <p className="mb-6">
        Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language.
        It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985-1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
        This tutorial gives enough understanding of the Python programming language.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Why to Learn Python?</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented scripting language.
        Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas other languages use punctuation,
        and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become great Software Engineers, especially when working in the Web Development Domain.
        Some key advantages of learning Python include:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-6">
        <li>Python is Interpreted - Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
        <li>Python is Interactive - You can sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
        <li>Python is Object-Oriented - Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
        <li>Python is a Beginner's Language - Python is a great language for beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Characteristics of Python</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Following are important characteristics of Python Programming:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-6">
        <li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li>
        <li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li>
        <li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li>
        <li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li>
        <li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Python is one of the most widely used languages over the web. Here are a few reasons why Python is popular:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-6">
        <li>Easy-to-learn - Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows students to pick up the language quickly.</li>
        <li>Easy-to-read - Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li>
        <li>Easy-to-maintain - Python's source code is fairly easy to maintain.</li>
        <li>A broad standard library - Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
        <li>Interactive Mode - Python has support for an interactive mode that allows interactive testing and debugging of code snippets.</li>
        <li>Portable - Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</li>
        <li>Extendable - You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li>
        <li>Databases - Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</li>
        <li>GUI Programming - Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries, and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</li>
        <li>Scalable - Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">What you'll learn</h3>
      <ul className="mb-6">
        <li>Learn Python From the scratch</li>
        <li>Understanding Python Essentials and Concepts</li>
        <li>Hands-On project: Build a Web App Directory Discovery</li>
        <li>Practice Step By Step</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">Nothing, just patience and eagerness to learn!</p>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Who this course is for:</h3>
      <ul className="mb-6">
        <li>DevOps Engineers</li>
